# viking_quiz

Flutter Viking Conference Hackathon Submission.

Project created by Rebecca Burch and Sean Moore.

This is a quiz application that contains Nordic questions. The graphics were tailored to match
the viking theme of the conference.

Rebecca was instrumental in taking command of the user interface design, coding and implementation.

Sean helped with project code structure and a basic architecture to help organize the codebase.
